//! Parent side: [`EngineSupervisor`], the single owner of the transcribe.cpp
//! worker process.
//!
//! One owner thread works through a command queue and holds the only worker
//! slot, the loaded model's spec and any active stream, so "at most one
//! model worker alive" holds by construction. Callers' commands wait their
//! turn; waiting in the queue (e.g. behind a model load) is never a timeout.
//! Only [`EngineSupervisor::cancel`] and device probes bypass the queue: a
//! probe runs its own short-lived, model-less worker on the caller's thread,
//! so a hung GPU driver can't hold up dictation behind it.
//!
//! A worker that will only use the CPU is started CPU-only, so it never
//! registers a GPU backend. One rule decides: the spec it loads asks for
//! [`Backend::Cpu`] (the user's choice, or a fallback after a GPU failure),
//! or the host must not use the GPU at all.
