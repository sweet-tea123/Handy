//! Process isolation for transcribe.cpp.
//!
//! All transcribe.cpp native code (backend init, device enumeration, model
//! load, inference, streaming) runs in a child process: the Handy executable
//! re-launched with [`WORKER_FLAG`]. A GPU driver fault, `GGML_ASSERT` abort,
//! or hang then kills only the worker.
//!
//! [`EngineSupervisor`] is the single owner of that worker. It loads and
//! unloads models, runs and streams transcriptions, cancels them, and
//! recovers from crashes and hangs (retrying in a CPU-only worker when the
//! GPU was at fault), so the rest of the app never sees processes, restarts
//! or fallback. At most one worker holds a model at a time, and it lives
//! exactly as long as that model, so unloading returns all of its CPU and GPU
//! memory to the OS. Listing compute devices may briefly run a second,
//! model-less worker.
//!
//! A CPU-only worker ([`CPU_ONLY_FLAG`]) restricts transcribe.cpp to its CPU
//! backends before any are registered, so no GPU driver code runs in it at
//! all: a driver that crashes or hangs while initializing can't take the CPU
//! fallback down with it.
//!
//! - `protocol`: the framed request/response protocol between the two.
//! - `supervisor`: the parent side ([`EngineSupervisor`]).
//! - `worker`: the child process.
